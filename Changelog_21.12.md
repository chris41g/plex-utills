## Version 22.08

It's been a while since the application has been updated, but those on the discord will know there has been a lot of changes happening in the background preparing for this update. 

There are some major changes to this version, primarily around backing up your posters so you can restore them easily if things go wrong. 

There has also been a lot of work done to the TV posters, banners can now be added to your episode posters as well as the seasons so you can see at a glance whether the episode is 4k, hdr or atmos enabled.
